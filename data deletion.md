Data Deletion Instructions for Facebook OAuth

If you've used Facebook OAuth to authenticate or sign in to a third-party application or website, you may want to delete the associated data and revoke the app's access to your Facebook account. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this:

1. Revoke App Access from Facebook:

Log in to your Facebook account.
Go to Settings by clicking on the downward arrow icon in the top-right corner of the Facebook interface.
In the Settings menu, select "Apps and Websites" from the left-hand sidebar.
You'll see a list of apps and websites that have access to your Facebook account. Find the app you want to revoke access to and click on it.
Click on the "Remove App" button to revoke access. Confirm your choice if prompted.
2. Delete Data Associated with the Third-Party App:

Log in to the third-party application or website where you used Facebook OAuth to authenticate.
Navigate to your account settings or profile settings within the app.
Look for an option related to connected accounts, linked accounts, or third-party integrations.
Find the option to disconnect or remove the Facebook connection.
Follow the on-screen instructions to disconnect your Facebook account and delete any associated data from the app's servers.
3. Contact the App's Support Team (Optional):

If you're unable to delete your data through the app's interface or if you have concerns about data retention, consider reaching out to the app's support team.
Look for contact information such as an email address or support form on the app's website or within the app itself.
Send a request to the support team asking them to delete your account and associated data from their servers. Provide any relevant details, such as your account username or email address, to help them locate your data.
4. Review Privacy Policy and Data Retention Practices:

Before using Facebook OAuth or any third-party authentication method in the future, review the privacy policy and data retention practices of the app or website.
Make sure you understand how your data will be used, stored, and shared, and whether you have control over deleting your account and data.
By following these steps, you can revoke access to your Facebook account from third-party apps and delete any associated data, helping to protect your privacy and data security.
